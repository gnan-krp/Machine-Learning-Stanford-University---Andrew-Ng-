"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programmed."  --Arthur Sameul(1959)

A scientist named Arthur Sameul once made a program of a game of checkers, he himself did not knew how to play checkers. So, he made a machine that can play checkers,he gave 10000 several 
games to the machine and if it had won it got a reward and lose then get a punishment. Gradually, the computer itself played several games by itself to get better. As, the time passed
the machine got better and better and got metter than the scientist himself. This method of machine learning is hit and trial method because I learned the same method in the AI Fundamentals
IBM course.

There Are Two Types Of Machine Learning:
  1. Supervised Learning ---> Supervised learning is used most in the real world applications
  2. Unsupervised learning

1. Supervised Learning :-
    Supervised learning is the type of machine learning that refers to the algorithm that learns x to y mappings or input to output mappings.

                       x      ----------->     y
                     input    ----------->   output
   
    You give the learning algorithm examples that has "right answers" y  for the correct input x.
    By practising this a numerous times the algorithm than learns to have only input x without output y.
    By the input x, the computer than predicts the output y without knowing the correct output. By these
    predictions we can make pecautionary steps for t a better future.
