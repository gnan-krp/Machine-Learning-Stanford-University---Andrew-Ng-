After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning. But don't let the name uncivilized for you, 
unsupervised learning is I think just as super as supervised learning. When we're looking at supervised learning ,it looks something like this 
in the case of a classification problem. Each example, was associated with an output label y such as benign or malignant, designated by the 
poles and crosses in unsupervised learning. Were given data that isn't associated with any output labels y,say you're given data on patients 
and their tumor size and the patient's age. But not whether the tumor was benign or malignant, so the dataset looks like this. 

We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we're not given any labels. Why in the dataset, instead, our job
is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data. This is unsupervised learning, we call it 
unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm. To give some quote right answer for every input, instead, we asked our 
room to figure out all by yourself what's interesting. Or what patterns or structures that might be in this data, with this particular data 
set. An unsupervised learning algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters. And so 
it might decide, that there's one cluster what group over here, and there's another cluster or group over here. 

This is a particular type of unsupervised learning, called a clustering algorithm. Because it places the unlabeled data, into different 
clusters and this turns out to be used in many applications. For example, clustering is used in google news, what google news does is
every day it goes and looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet, and groups related stories together.
