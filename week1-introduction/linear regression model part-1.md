 The first model of my course, Linear Regression Model. That just means fitting a straight line to the data. It's probably the most widely 
 used learning algorithm in the world today. 
 
 We're going to use a dataset on house sizes and prices from Portland, a city in the United States. Here we have a graph where the horizontal 
 axis is the size of the house in square feet, and the vertical axis is the price of a house in thousands of dollars. We plot the data points 
 for various houses in the dataset. Here each data point, each of these little crosses is a house with the size and the price that it most 
 recently was sold for. Now, let's say I am a real estate agent in Portland and am helping a client to sell her house. She is asking me, how 
 much do I think I can get for this house?

 This dataset might help me estimate the price she could get for it. I start by measuring the size of the house, and it turns out that the
 house is 1250 square feet. One thing I could do is, I can build a linear regression model from this dataset. My model will fit a straight 
 line to the data. Based on this straight line fit to the data, I can see that the house is 1250 square feet, and if I trace that to the 
 vertical axis on the left, I can see the price is maybe around $220,000. This is an example of what's called a supervised learning model.
